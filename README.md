`censusapi` is a lightweight package to get data from the U.S. Census Bureau's [APIs](https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html). More than [1,000 Census API endpoints](https://api.census.gov/data.html) are available, including the Decennial Census, American Community Survey, Poverty Statistics, Population Estimates, and Census microdata. This package is designed to let you get data from all of those APIs using the same main functions and syntax for every dataset.

`getCensus()` is designed to work with any new Census API endpoint when it is released, as long as it conforms to Census's existing standards. The package also includes metadata functions so that users determine [which datasets](https://www.hrecht.com/censusapi/reference/listCensusApis.html) are available and [for each dataset](https://www.hrecht.com/censusapi/reference/listCensusMetadata.html), what variables, geographies, and groups can be used.

## Installation
Get the latest stable release from CRAN: 
```R
install.packages("censusapi")
```

You can also install the latest development version of `censusapi` from Github using `devtools`:
```R
# Install the devtools package if needed
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hrecht/censusapi")
```

## Basic usage
Using the [Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/Poverty-Statistics.html) dataset, get the poverty rate [(SAEPOVRTALL_PT)](https://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/poverty/saipe/variables/SAEPOVRTALL_PT.html) for every year since 2010 in Los Angeles County, CA.

```R
poverty_rate <- getCensus(
	name = "timeseries/poverty/saipe",
	vars = c("NAME", "SAEPOVRTALL_PT"),
	region = "county:037",
	regionin = "state:06",
	time = "from 2010")

poverty_rate
#>    time 	state county NAME 				SAEPOVRTALL_PT
#> 1  2010  06    037 	 Los Angeles County           17.6
#> 2  2011  06    037    Los Angeles County           18.4
#> 3  2012  06    037    Los Angeles County           19.1
#> 4  2013  06    037    Los Angeles County           19.0
#> 5  2014  06    037    Los Angeles County           18.7
#> 6  2015  06    037    Los Angeles County           16.7
#> 7  2016  06    037    Los Angeles County           16.3
#> 8  2017  06    037    Los Angeles County           14.9
#> 9  2018  06    037    Los Angeles County           14.2
#> 10 2019  06    037    Los Angeles County           13.4
#> 11 2020  06    037    Los Angeles County           13.2
#> 12 2021  06    037    Los Angeles County           14.1
#> 13 2022  06    037    Los Angeles County           13.9

Using the 2022 [5-year American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html) Subject Tables dataset, for all Census tracts in Arizona, get the:

* total number of households [(S2801_C01_001E)](https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5/subject/variables/S2801_C01_001E.html)
* number of households without an internet subscription [(S2801_C01_019E)](https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5/subject/variables/S2801_C01_019E.html)
* percent of households without an internet subscription [(S2801_C02_019E)](https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs5/subject/variables/S2801_C02_019E.html)
* Census tract name

```R
no_internet <- getCensus(
	name = "acs/acs5/subject",
	vintage = 2022,
	vars = c("S2801_C01_001E", "S2801_C01_019E", "S2801_C02_019E", "NAME"),
	region = "tract:*",
	regionin = "state:04")
