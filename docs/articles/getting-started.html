<p><code>censusapi</code> is a lightweight package that helps you
retrieve data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html" class="external-link">1,600 API
endpoints</a> using one simple function, <code><a href="../reference/getCensus.html">getCensus()</a></code>.
Additional functions provide information about what datasets are
available and how to use them.</p>
<p>This package returns the data as-is with the original variable names
created by the Census Bureau and any quirks inherent in the data. Each
dataset is a little different. Some are documented thoroughly, others
have documentation that is sparse. Sometimes variable names change each
year. This package can’t overcome those challenges, but tries to make it
easier to get the data for use in your analysis. Make sure to thoroughly
read the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html" class="external-link">documentation</a>
for your dataset and see below for how to <a href="#Other-ways-to-get-help">get help with Census data.</a></p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="api-key-setup">API key setup<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#api-key-setup"></a>
</h2>
<p><code>censusapi</code> recommends but does not require using an API
key from the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau may limit the number
of requests made by your IP address if you do not use an API key.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html" class="external-link">sign up
online</a> to receive a key, which will be sent to your provided email
address.</p>
<p>If you save the key with the name <code>CENSUS_KEY</code> or
<code>CENSUS_API_KEY</code> in your Renviron file,
<code>censusapi</code> will use it by default without any extra work on
your part.</p>
<p>To save your API key, within R, run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># Check to see if you already have a CENSUS_KEY or CENSUS_API_KEY saved</span></span>
<span><span class="co"># If so, no further action is needed</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/get_api_key.html">get_api_key</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span class="co"># If not, add your key to your Renviron file</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Sys.setenv.html" class="external-link">Sys.setenv</a></span><span class="op">(</span>CENSUS_KEY<span class="op">=</span><span class="va">PASTEYOURKEYHERE</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span class="co"># Reload .Renviron</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/readRenviron.html" class="external-link">readRenviron</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"~/.Renviron"</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span class="co"># Check to see that the expected key is output in your R console</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/get_api_key.html">get_api_key</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In some instances you might not want to put your key in your
.Renviron - for example, if you’re on a shared school computer. You can
always choose to manually set <code>key = "PASTEYOURKEYHERE"</code> as
an argument in <code><a href="../reference/getCensus.html">getCensus()</a></code> if you prefer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="basic-usage">Basic usage<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#basic-usage"></a>
</h2>
<p>The main function in <code>censusapi</code> is
<code><a href="../reference/getCensus.html">getCensus()</a></code>, which makes an API call to a given endpoint
and returns a data frame with results. Each API has slightly different
parameters, but there are always a few required arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>name</code>: the programmatic name of the endpoint as defined
by the Census, like “acs/acs5” or “timeseries/bds/firms”</li>
<li>
<code>vintage</code>: the survey year, required for aggregate or
microdata APIs</li>
<li>
<code>vars</code>: a list of variables to retrieve</li>
<li>
<code>region</code>: the geography level to retrieve, such as state
or county, required for nearly all endpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>Some APIs have additional required or optional arguments, like
<code>time</code> for some timeseries datasets. Check the specific <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html" class="external-link">documentation</a>
for your API and explore its metadata with
<code><a href="../reference/listCensusMetadata.html">listCensusMetadata()</a></code> to see what options are allowed.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through an example getting uninsured rates using the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/Health-Insurance-Statistics.html" class="external-link">Small
Area Health Insurance Estimates API</a>, which provides detailed annual
state-level and county-level estimates of health insurance rates for
people below age 65.</p>

<p><code>censusapi</code> includes a metadata function called
<code><a href="../reference/listCensusMetadata.html">listCensusMetadata()</a></code> to get information about an API’s
variable and geography options. Let’s see what variables are available

<p>Because the SAHIE API is a timeseries dataset, as indicated in its
<code>name</code>,, we can get multiple years of data at once by
changing <code>time = YYYY</code> to
<code>time = "from YYYY to YYYY"</code>, or get through the latest data
available using <code>time = "from YYYY"</code>. Let’s get that data for
DeKalb County, Georgia using county fips code 089 and state fips code
13. You can look up fips codes on the <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi.html" class="external-link">Census
Bureau website</a>.</p>

<p>Most users will work with summary data, either aggregate or
timeseries. Summary data contains pre-calculated numbers or percentages
for a given statistic — like the number of children in a state or the
median household income. The examples below and in the broader <a href="https://www.hrecht.com/censusapi/articles/example-list.html">list
of censusapi examples</a> use summary data.</p>
<p>Aggregate datasets, like the American Community Survey or Decennial
Census, include data for only one time period (a <code>vintage</code>),
usually one year. Datasets like the American Community Survey contain
thousands of these pre-computed variables.</p>
<p>Timeseries datasets, including the Small Area Income and Poverty
Estimates, the Quarterly Workforce Estimates, and International Trade
statistics, allow users to query data over time in a single API
call.</p>
<p>Microdata contains the individual-level responses for a survey for
use in custom analysis. One row represents one person. Only advanced
analysts will want to use microdata. Learn more about what microdata is

</h2>
<p>For some surveys, including the American Community Survey and
Decennial Census, you can get many related variables at once using a
variable <code>group</code>. These groups are defined by the Census
Bureau. In some other data tools, like <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/" class="external-link">data.census.gov</a>, this concept
is referred to as a <code>table</code>.</p>
<p>Some groups have several dozen variables, others just have a few. As
an example, we’ll use the American Community Survey to get the estimate,
margin of error and annotations for median household income in the past
12 months for Census places (cities, towns, etc) in Alabama using group
<code>B19013</code>.</p>
<p>First, see descriptions of the variables in group B19013:</p>

<p>Now, retrieve the data using <code>vars = "group(B19013)"</code>. You
could alternatively manually list each variable as
<code>vars = c("NAME", "B19013_001E", "B19013_001EA", "B19013_001M", "B19013_001MA")</code>,
but using the groups is much easier.</p>

<p>Some geographies, particularly Census tracts and blocks, need to be
specified within larger geographies like states and counties. This
varies by API endpoint, so make sure to read the documentation for your
specific API and run
<code>listCensusMetadata(type = "geographies")</code> to see the
available options.</p>
<p>Tract-level data from the 2010 Decennial Census can only be requested
from one state at a time. In this example, we use the built in
