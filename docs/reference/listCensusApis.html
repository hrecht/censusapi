These data are collected through combined computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI).

<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 2 The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these data. The Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment projections. To allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of hispanics, additional Hispanic sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.</span>

The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Much of the ACS data provided on the Census Bureau's Web site are available separately by age group, race, Hispanic origin, and sex. Summary files, Subject tables, Data profiles, and Comparison profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Detailed Tables contain the most detailed cross-tabulations published for areas 65k and more. The data are population counts. There are over 31,000 variables in this dataset.</span>

<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 3 The Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM) Benchmark provides key intercensal measures of manufacturing activity and products for the public and private sectors for four years following the Economic Census of Manufacturing. These benchmark tables present manufacturing establishment statistics from the 2013-2016 Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM). The ASM Benchmark provides statistics on employment, payroll, worker hours, cost of materials, value added by manufacturing, inventories, and estimates for value of shipments for product classes of products manufactured as defined by the North American Industry Classification System. The ASM provides the best current measure of current U.S. manufacturing industry outputs, inputs, and operating status, and is the primary basis for updates of the Longitudinal Research Database (LRD). Census Bureau staff and academic researchers with sworn agent status use the LRD for micro data analysis.</span>

<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 1 The U.S. Census Bureau's Small Area Health Insurance Estimates program produces the only source of data for single-year estimates of health insurance coverage status for all counties in the U.S. by selected economic and demographic characteristics. This program is partially funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Division of Cancer Prevention and Control (DCPC). The CDC have a congressional mandate to provide screening services for breast and cervical cancer to low-income, uninsured, and underserved women through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP). For estimation, SAHIE uses statistical models that combine survey data from the American Community Survey (ACS) with administrative records data and Census 2020 data.</span>
