The Census APIs have more than 1,000 endpoints, covering dozens of different surveys. This page shows how to get data from most of the key surveys using `censusapi`.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(censusapi)
```

To see a current table of every available endpoint, run `listCensusApis`:
```{r}
apis <- listCensusApis()
```

## American Community Survey
There are multiple useful ACS datasets with slightly different purposes. Here's how the Census Bureau [describes them](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html):
"Detailed Tables contain the most detailed cross-tabulations, many of which are published down to block groups. The data are population counts. There are over 20,000 variables in this dataset.

Subject Tables provide an overview of the estimates available in a particular topic.  The data are presented as population counts and percentages.  There are over 18,000 variables in this dataset. 

Data Profiles contain broad social, economic, housing, and demographic information. The data are presented as population counts and percentages. There are over 1,000 variables in this dataset.

Comparison Profiles are similar to Data Profiles but also include comparisons with past-year data.  The current year data are compared with prior 5-Year data and include statistical significance testing.  There are over 1,000 variables in this dataset."
